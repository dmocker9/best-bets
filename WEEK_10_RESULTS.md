## 💡 Week 10 Insights

### What Worked
- **High confidence favorites at home** (Seahawks -6.5): When we have 80%+ confidence in a home favorite, they tend to deliver
- **Underdog value picks** (Saints +5.5, Giants +4.5): Our model found good value in underdogs getting extra points
- **Late-week games** (Chargers -3): Sunday night/Monday games gave us strong picks

### What Didn't Work
- **Division games with elite defenses**: Rams' defense (8.2 SRS) was too much for 49ers. Division familiarity didn't help the underdog here.

### Key Takeaways
- 80% win rate this week! Much improved from Week 9's 60%
- Bet of the Week continues perfect 2-0 record
- Overall record now at 70% (7-3) - exceeding standard betting benchmarks
- Underdog picks (Saints +5.5, Giants +4.5) both hit - model is finding good value
