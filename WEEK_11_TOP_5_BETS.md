**📈 Edge:** 4.2 points

### 🏥 Injury Impact:

**New York Giants (Losing Team, But Covering):**
- **Paulson Adebo (CB)**: 66.4% snaps × 0.6 weight = **0.399 DEF impact**
- **John Michael Schmitz (C)**: 69.2% snaps × 0.3 weight = **0.208 OFF impact**

**Total Impact:**

- Defensive: 0.596 → 6.0% penalty → 94.0/100

**Green Bay Packers:**
- **Nate Hobbs (CB)**: 48.7% snaps × 0.6 weight = **0.292 DEF impact**
- **Matthew Golden (WR)**: 53.1% snaps × 0.4 weight = **0.212 OFF impact**

**Total Impact:**
- Offensive: 0.212 → 1.8% penalty → 98.2/100
- Defensive: 0.373 → 3.7% penalty → 96.3/100

### 💡 Why This Bet:
Model predicts Packers win by only 2.8 points. Vegas has Giants +7. That's a **4.2-point cushion**. Even if Packers win, Giants should cover easily. Both teams have similar injury impacts (~2% OFF, ~4-6% DEF).

## #2: **Buffalo Bills -6**

**🏈 Game:** Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Buffalo Bills  
**📊 Vegas Line:** Bills -6  
**🎯 Model Pick:** Bills by 1.4 points  
**💰 Bet:** **Bills -6** (Model sees value, but edge just under threshold)  
**💯 Confidence:** 52.9% - VALUE PLAY  
**📈 Edge:** 4.6 points  
**Quality Score:** 245.2 (High value, moderate confidence)

### 🏥 Injury Impact:

**Buffalo Bills:**

- Defensive: 0.368 → 3.7% penalty → 96.3/100

### 💡 Why This Bet:
Model shows Bills winning by only 1.4 points, but Vegas has them -6. This is a **4.6-point edge** but confidence is lower (53%). Defensive injuries to pass rushers may make game closer than expected.

**📊 Vegas Line:** Texans -7.5

**Tennessee Titans:**
- ✅ No significant injuries

### 💡 Why This Bet:
Even with **C.J. Stroud (star QB) out**, the model predicts Texans winning by 10.3 points. Why? 
- Texans have **elite defense** (9.80 SRS)
- Titans are one of the **worst teams in NFL** (-9.0 SRS)
- The 11.1% offensive penalty still leaves Texans better than Titans
- **2.8-point edge** over Vegas -7.5 line

- Defensive: 0.000 → 0.0% penalty → 100.0/100
