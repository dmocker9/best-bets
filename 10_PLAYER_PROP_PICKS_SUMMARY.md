## 🏈 QUARTERBACKS (3 Picks)

### 1. **Patrick Mahomes - Passing Yards O/U 260.5** @ Denver Broncos

**Player Stats:**
- Season Average: 261.0 pass yds/game

- Completions: 22.67/game

**Opponent Defense (DEN):**
- Pass Yards Allowed: 206.6 yds/game (League Avg: ~220)
- **Defensive Ranking:** Top 5 pass defense (very strong)

**Matchup Analysis:**
- Mahomes averages exactly 261 yds/game, right at the line
