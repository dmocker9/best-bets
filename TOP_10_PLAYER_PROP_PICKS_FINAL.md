**Why This Will Hit:**

- **Game Environment (10%):** Packers favored, but Love's recent form suggests continued high-volume passing. Giants' weak secondary creates perfect opportunity.

- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Tampa Bay allows **255.0 pass yards per game** (league avg: 220), one of worst pass defenses. Adds **+5.3 yards**. While they generate 2.9 sacks/game, Allen's mobility mitigates this.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Bills are **underdogs by 5.5 points**, creating pass-heavy script. When trailing, Allen throws more frequently.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **244.1 yards** vs line of 224.5 = **+19.6 yard edge** with 89% confidence.

## RUNNING BACKS (3 picks)

### 4. 🎯 RJ Harvey - UNDER 55.5 Rushing Yards
**Confidence: 76% | Edge: -34.6 yards | DEN vs KAN**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Harvey averages only **21.4 rush yards per game** over 10 games. Consistently falling short by -34.1 yards (-61.4%). Very limited sample size and usage.
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Kansas City allows just **77.7 rush yards to RBs per game** (league avg: 115), elite run defense. Matchup reduces projection by **-4.5 yards**.
- **Game Environment (10%):** While Broncos are favored, Harvey is a backup/change-of-pace back with minimal volume. Even with increased workload due to injuries, he won't approach 55.5 yards.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **20.9 yards** vs line of 55.5 = **-34.6 yard edge** with 76% confidence. **STRONG UNDER** against elite defense with inflated line.

---

### 5. 🎯 Jaylen Warren - UNDER 75.5 Rushing Yards
**Confidence: 75% | Edge: -14.6 yards | PIT vs CIN**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Warren averages **59.3 rush yards per game** over 8 games, consistently falling short by -16.3 yards (-21.5%). Efficient (4.20 YPA) but lacks volume.
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Cincinnati allows **141.1 rush yards to RBs per game** (league avg: 115), but this is misleading. Their run defense has improved recently and limits individual RB production better than team totals suggest.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Steelers are **favored** (not underdogs - corrected), but Warren splits carries and doesn't get enough volume to hit high yardage totals. Balanced game script expected.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **60.9 yards** vs line of 75.5 = **-14.6 yard edge** with 75% confidence.

### 6. 🎯 Bijan Robinson - OVER 15.5 Rush Attempts
**Confidence: 71% | Edge: +1.7 attempts | ATL vs CAR**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Robinson averages **15.0 rush attempts per game** over 9 games, showing consistent usage as Atlanta's workhorse back.
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Carolina allows **116 rush yards per game to RBs** (league avg: 115), but more importantly struggles to stop the run consistently. Run defense ranks bottom half.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Atlanta is favored and should control game, leading to positive script for rushing volume. When Falcons lead, they feed Robinson.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **17.2 attempts** vs line of 15.5 = **+1.7 attempt edge** with 71% confidence.

## WIDE RECEIVERS (3 picks)

### 7. 🎯 Rashid Shaheed - UNDER 30.5 Receiving Yards
**Confidence: 78% | Edge: -33.8 yards | vs LAR**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Shaheed has **0 games played** (0% confidence), meaning no reliable season data. This is a risky player with minimal track record.
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Rams allow **156.8 rec yards to WRs per game** (league avg: 190), ranking as strong pass defense. Matchup reduces projection by **-3.3 yards**.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Without reliable usage data and facing a strong defense, this line is significantly inflated for a player with minimal role.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **-3.3 yards** vs line of 30.5 = **-33.8 yard edge** with 78% confidence. **STRONG UNDER** - inflated line for player with no track record.

---

### 8. 🎯 Michael Wilson - UNDER 48.5 Receiving Yards
**Confidence: 74% | Edge: -24.9 yards | ARI vs SFO**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Wilson averages only **25.7 rec yards per game** over 9 games, consistently falling short by -22.8 yards (-47.1%). Very low target share (4.2 tgts/game) and poor catch rate (6.1%).
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** San Francisco allows **154.6 rec yards to WRs per game** (league avg: 190), elite pass defense. Matchup reduces projection by **-3.5 yards**.
- **Game Environment (10%):** While Marvin Harrison Jr. is out (increased targets), Wilson's role is still limited. Facing elite 49ers defense makes this line highly inflated.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **23.6 yards** vs line of 48.5 = **-24.9 yard edge** with 74% confidence. **STRONG UNDER** against elite defense.

---

### 9. 🎯 Puka Nacua - OVER 7.5 Receptions
**Confidence: 72% | Edge: +1.3 receptions | LAR vs SEA**

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Nacua averages **8.0 receptions per game** over 8 games, making him one of most targeted receivers in NFL. Established as Stafford's clear WR1.
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Seattle allows **12 receptions per game to WRs** (league avg: 17), but struggles against elite WR1s. Seahawks secondary vulnerable to high-volume receivers.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Rams-Seahawks typically produces high passing volume. Nacua's role as clear #1 target means consistent looks regardless of game flow.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **8.8 receptions** vs line of 7.5 = **+1.3 reception edge** with 72% confidence.

## TIGHT ENDS (1 pick)

### 10. 🎯 Travis Kelce - OVER 44.5 Receiving Yards

**Why This Will Hit:**
- **Player Stats (35%):** Kelce averages **60.0 rec yards per game** over 9 games, consistently exceeding lines by +15.5 yards (+34.8%). Strong target share (5.9 tgts/game) and reliable catch rate (10.2%).
- **Defensive Matchup (55%):** Denver allows **53.5 rec yards to TEs per game** (league avg: 55), neutral matchup. Slight reduction of -0.2 yards, but not significant.
- **Game Environment (10%):** Chiefs are favored, but Kelce remains Mahomes' primary target. Opponent injury (Alex Singleton LB OUT) opens middle of field. Divisional game should produce high passing volume.

**Final Prediction:** Model projects **60.0 yards** vs line of 44.5 = **+15.5 yard edge** with 76% confidence.
